      <h1>About 'Flying Through Time'</h1>
      <p>The project will be an interactive globe visualizing the different factors affecting the evolution of aviation over time. The domain/URL will be www.flyingthroughtime.org. The website will be centralized around a globe including our three major airports. There will be an area available to the user allowing a choice of what will be visualized (i.e. average altitudes, number of flights, specific airport, average number of passengers per plane, etc.). If the user is to select number of flights for a particular airport, it would be visualized by an airplane icon (every airplane icon represents 1,000 flights). If the user is to select average altitude, it would be visualized by the distance away from the globe; cumulitive altitude would be displayed by stacking the average altitude distances on top of one another. If the user is to select average number of passengers per plane, the airplane icon would be enlarged or shrunk. Within all of these options, scrolling over the icon would allow the historical data to emerge. There will be a time slider on the bottom, which would demonstrate the change of these variables over time.</p>
      <h2>Functionality & Technology</h2>
      <p>The user will be able to select different factors that demonstrate the evolution of aviation over time, such as the average altitude of a  airplane throughout history, which airport to compare (the selection of domestic flights or international flights) and the cumulitive altitude of the total number of flights. Users will be able to interact with this project via the Web (URL above).</p>
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>Not only will scholars find the visualization of historical evolution of aviation innovative and insightful, but the ‘flying’ public will have a deeper understanding of the implications of advancing aviation technology on our world of global transportation. There is a broad interest in aviation, including policy makers, international companies, government agencies, weather trackers, etc.</p>
      <h2>Data, Information, & Content</h2>
      <p>We will draw on governmental and private aviation archives, such as the National Archives for the FAA (http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/237.html) Historical Aircraft Movement Data (e.g. http://www.knoxcountymaine.gov/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B32E24548-10E4-4BF4-81C6-A8C8C86D956E%7D) ,  and combine multiple sources in order to fully visualize the history of commercial flight.  On the international level, we will be using data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] (http://www.wcarn.com/cache/news/17/17204.html) and the UK Department of Transport Civil Aviation Authority (http://www.caa.co.uk/). 
Open Flights (http://openflights.org/)</p>
      <h2>Partners</h2>
      <p>Our fundamental data will be provided by the National Archives for the FAA,  the CAAC, and the UK Department of Transportation CAA, including them as partners on our project. The role of these institutions will be our main sources of data collection and analysis. The final project will allow these partners, as well as anyone interested, access to the visualized history and evolution of aviation over the past 100 years. We will also be using the Smithsonian Aviation Museum as a partner for the use of the evolution of aviation technology through this time. </p>
